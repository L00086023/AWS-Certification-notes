                                                        :Simple Storage Service(S3)= Object level storage
                                                        :Glacier = This is for storing large amounts of data that is not accessed frequently or rquires instant access.
                                                        :CloudFront = Information that is accessed frequently is cached at an Edge Location near to the customer.
                                                        : Elastic Block Store (EBS)= This is the best storage option to use when instances need very fast access at block level
Q2:What is the Storage Gateway and what does it do?
A2:Its an appliance hardware or software that put on the local network either as a software appliance or a hardware appliance that acts as a VPN connection into the Amazon Cloud so that storage can be accessed as if it were local storage.


Q3: What is the Snow Family?
A3: The Snow Fmily is a collection of three primary products that can  be used to migrate  data from a local store(s) into the Cloud.

Q4: Where is Block storage used?
A4:Block storage  is used on local networks.

Q5:what is iSCSI
A5: It's  an acronym for Internet Small Computer Systems Interface, an Internet Protocol (IP)-based storage networking standard for linking data storage facilities. It provides block-level access to storage devices by carrying SCSI commands over a TCP/IP network.

Q6: How does file storage differ from block storage?
A6:File storage is concerned with objects/chunks of information, AWS   uses File  Storage  for   this purpose.

Q7: Describe File Storage?
A7:File Storage is used all the time on local networks with NAS  devices

Q8:What is a NAS  device?
A8: Network-attached storage(NAS) is a file-level computer data storage server connected to a computer network providing data access to a heterogeneous group of clients.

Q9:What are the factors that need to be considered when selecting a storage service?
A9: SIZE: The size of each object(file)  and the amount of total storage  required has to be considered.
   PERFORMANCE: ie speed of access, how quickly can a user get access to objects stored?
   COST:S3  will provide much faster access than Glacier but it will be much more expensive.

****************** S3  storage class (Episode 2.02, Video 7mins 22 secs Objective 1.4 Choose appropriate resilient storage)

S3 WILL DEFINITLY BE ON THE EXAM
Q10:What does S3 do?
A10:S3 stores objects.An object can be a file or any big chunk of data.
Q12:How does S3 store objects?
A12:S3 automatically distributed objects across at least three Availability Zones by default.This ensures that if one server is down the object will still be available in a bucket

Q13: Describe 1A  class of storage and how it differs fro m standard S3 storage.
A13  1A class of storage uses only one AZ of storage, not three AZ's  as is standard.A1  storage is cheaper but its less available and less recoverable.

Q14:What is meant by Data Classification?
A14: Data can be classified as follows:
                                     - Security purposes
                                     -Managment of data
                                     Automated processing of data can then take place, base on the classification of the data.


Q15: How is data placed in an S3 bucket?
A15: 1: API's
   2:Amazon Direct Connect = Creates a VPN connection from the users business network into AWS
   3: Storage Gateway = Data can be stored locally (on the Cloud) and replicated or synchronized into an S3 bucket.
   4:Kinesis Firehose = It a way of getting large amounts of anyalithical data into S3
   5:Transfer acceleration = Its based on cloud front technology which creates an optomized route into  the S3 buckets. Transfer Acceleration will cost more than standard.
   6 Snow family of products
                            -Snowball  =1 Petabyte of data
                           - Snowball Edge = 1 Terabyte, It's a device that the user can have on-premises and transfer the datainto it. The device is then brought back to AWS and the data is transferred into the Cloud.
                           - Snowmobile = A large trailer/data centre on wheels  that is sent to the user location along with AWS staff. Each trailer can store 100 petabytes of data           1000 petapytes = 1 Exabyte

********************************* S3 Advanced features (Episode 2.04, Video 7mins 49 secs Objective 1.4 Choose appropriate resilient storage)***************************************************************
Q26:So why bother learning/remembering all this stuff about S3 Buckets?
A26: Knowing these details will in the exam, as it will be easier to figure out the right answer.

Q27: Why is it neccesary to understand the key concepts within the S3  storage system?
A27: Understanding the key concepts of the S3 Storage system helps the user to better structure organize structure so that data is stored in te most cost effective way in S3.


Q28:Explain what is meant by prefixes and delimiters?
A28:A  prefix is just a word, string of letters/characters or numbers and a delimiter is the slash mark that seperates one prefix from another before the final object.It looks like a folder structur but its not.

Q29:Why are there different storage classes?
A29:Different storage classes exist so that data can be stored and accessed for different periods of time and with different levels of accessibility.

Q30:List the different storage classes.
A30: The storage classes are:
                         - S3 Standard = Most Expensive. 
                         - S3 Infrequent Access =
                         - S3 Reduced Redundancy Storage =  Cheaper than Standard or Infrequent:Its the least tolreable to failure,least available
                         - S3 Glacier = Cheapest for storage,however the price can rise very steeply if the user recovers more than 5% of total data in one calender month.

Q31:What is Object Lifcycle Managment
A31:Object Lifecycle Managment  is  a means of managing the S3 Storage classes in the most efficent/least expensive ways. The user can specify that data is moved to different classes, in order to minimize costs.An example being of data in 	S3 Standard class which is moved to S3 Infrequent Access class after 60 days and after a further 60 days is moved to S3 Glacier. The data object remains at all time within the Bucket in which it was created.

Q32:Explain what is meant by Server-Side Encryption
A32:The data is encrypted after the filer is sent to the server. Once the file is uploaded to the S3 Bucket,AWS  does 256-bit encryption automatically.Likewise if someone requires the file it will be decrypted automatically. The file is not encrypted in transit.

Q33: Explain what is meant by Client-Side Encryption?
A33: The file is encrypted on the Client side and then uploaded to the S3 Bucket,so its encrypted during transit.

Q34: With Client-Side Encryption what is the user required to keep?
A34: The user needs to keep/maintain keys on the Client side to decrypt the file locally.

Q35: Explain  what is meant by versioning?
A35:Versioning allows the user to have multiple versions of the same object in the S3 Bucket.

Q36:What should the user bear in mind about Versioning?
A36: Versoning is not turned on by default, the user must enable it and once it's enabled it can't be disabled, however the user can make it so that it's not active.

Q37:Why is it not allowed to disable versioning?
A37: It would then be Amazons responsibility to figure out which versions to keep and which ones to discard.

Q38: What is 256-AES Encryption?
A38: It stands for Advanced Encryption Standard.Its used by the U.S. goverment, AWS and others(?) to encrypt sensative data.

Q39:Explain how Multi-Factor- Authentication Delete work?
A39: In order to Delete a file the user , while logged in must provide a code that has been sent to their mobile phone/tablet in order to delete the file.

Q40:What is meant by Multi-part upload?
A40:A  large file,usually several Gigabytes in size  is uploaded in multiple streams so that it uploads faster. The file is then reassembled on the server side.


Q41:What is a range GET?
A41:A user may require data in a  large dataset object (stored in an S3 bucket ) ,from one point to another, this is known as a range GET.

Q42: Give an example of a range GET.
A42:A user may request data in the range 10 kilobytes to 20 kilobytes.

Q43:What is Cross-Region replication?
A43:Cross-Region replication indicate that an S3 Bucket in one AWS Region is also present in another AWS Region

Q44:What should the user bear in mind when enabling replication?
A44:Only new data that is being added to a bucket is being replicated, not anything that is already there.

Q45:What is the purpose of Logging in S3?
A45:A Log(record)adding, deleting, changing things in the bucket gets logged. 

Q46:Describe how Event Notification are used with Logging.
A46:An Event Notification in the form of an email or SMS  can be sent from the publisher(S3 bucket)) to a subscriber when certain events are logged/recorded.
