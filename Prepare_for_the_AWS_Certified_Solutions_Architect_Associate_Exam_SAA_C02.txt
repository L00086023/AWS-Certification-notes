                           AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C02): 1 Cloud Services Overview

*************************************************************************************************************************************************
1.Cloud Computing Overview
Cloud Computing defined(8m 8s)
Q1:What is Cloud Computing:
A: Its an Internet based solution.It operates on servers that are connected to the Internet.ie Dropbox(Storage in the Cloud) Google, Micosoft Azure, Amazon Web Services Its everything that you do on your local network except its being done in the Cloud
-Cloud Computing is processing on the Internet or a private network  where the exact processor location is unknown
-Use of AWS can reduce hardware, operatonal and deployment costs.
-Cloud computing still uses servers, they are simply hidden from view.

Q2:What are the benefits of Cloud Computing?
  A:             -Reduced Hardware costs 
                 Using the AWS Managment Console all of the servers required:ie Web server, Application Server, Database server, the network connections between them and the storage can be configured/created in a few minutes.
                Reduced
               -Reduce Operationasl Costs
                Operational costs using AWS are in the 5-10%  region of what it would cost on-premises
               -Reduce Deployment times:Using the AWS Console creating and configuring a Web server, an Application Server, Database server can be done in a few minutes not days, weeks or months as would be the case with on-premises.
                Increased
               -Increased resiliency : The ability to recover from  a failure or problem.AWS carries out healthchecks so that ifv an instance is unhealthy, a new one can be started immediatly and the user application continues running. All this is done automatically without any need for customer intervention.

                -Increased Performance
                 The customer can configure Auto-Scaling so that if a certain performance threshold is hit, new servers are added.Costs are only incurred as use increases. Using more AWS EC2, storage ect means more cost as sacale increase, no need to pay for it at the outset.

              -Capacity
               
                
                 

Q3: What are the Cloud Computing Models?(video 9m 31s)
Cloud Computing Models
                        - Full Cloud Deployment:All the components are in the Cloud,Database,compute processing,general storage & application logic.Nothing is on-premises.

                        - Hyprid Deployment:Some of the resources are on=premises and some on the cloud. 


Q: What are the terms that are used in 	Cloud Computing
 A:                        -Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS):	The entire infrastructure is in the cloud ie servers,possibly segments of networks and databases.

                         -Platform as a Service(PaaS):The customer does not manage the infrastructure, they manage the applications that are deployed on the platform(s).

                         -Software as a Service(SaaS):Thev customer uses the software they do not manage it, an example of SaaS is Google mail.

Q4 :History of AWS:Why are things changed?Why are they the way they are?
Q5: The AWS Platform :Understand the orgizational structure of the AWS Cloud.
Q6:AWS Products Overview: Understand the range of products and what they offer.
Q6: AWS Security and Compliance
Q7:Regions and Availability : Understand where(physically) its stored and how its managed.
